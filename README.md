# StrassenAlgorithm
 
This is an implementation of Strassen Matrix Multiplication Algorithm that uses Divide and Conqure.
The standard matrix multiplication has the time complexity of Î˜(N^3). which has 8 multiplications
Strassen Matrix Multiplication has only 7 multiplications. Therefore, resulting in a time complexity of:

The matricies have to be n x n matricies.
The input file should be in the format:

first line is the size of the square matrix n
then define matrix A of size n x n
then define matrix B of size n x n

the input file should be: input.txt
the output file after executing will be: output.txt
