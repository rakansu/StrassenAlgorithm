The matricies have to be n x n matricies.
The input file should be in the format:

2
1 1
1 1
2 2
2 2

first line is the size of the square matrix n
then define matrix A of size n x n
then define matrix B of size n x n

the input file should be: input.txt
the output file after executing will be: output.txt
